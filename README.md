Final Project

For my Final Project I decided to create a Visual Novel.

The app was initialized using npx-create-react-app which created the broiler plate react app template. 

Now as far as the engine to push the apps core function, I used the visual novel engine created by github user Nashkenazy. 
The link to his repository is below with the original code I used. 
https://github.com/nashkenazy/React-Visual-Novel

I more or less took his engine code, took it apart and striped it down to understand how it worked. I did make a few changes (not all successful) to the engine to get it work as I wanted.

The was also significant additional functionality in the engine such as configuration menus, 
fullscreen toggle, save/load slots, etc....however I decided to remove all that to make the app as simple as possible. 

I did add an element of user authentication to the initial landing page. It reads and writes user data to a MongoDB database. 
As of this build it doesn't actually do anything when logged in....but for the apps future....I would revamp the authentication to 
incorporate a payment system so the site could offer paid content. Akin to more "Mature" visual novels that would require one to pay to play.

So for this project....the Story, the Voices, and the Art was all done by me. (I'm also a freelance illustrator btw) Given the short time I 
had to create this....the art is finished in parts and unfinished in other parts....I fully intend to gradually polish the art up so it looks more uniform.

I used 3 sound effects that I sourced from the website https://freesound.org/

For future updates to this app, I would incorporate additional sound effects as well as music.

I also plan to do a cosmetic overall haul with a whole new landing page.
